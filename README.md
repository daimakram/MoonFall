#### Introduction:
Salvation is a web-based game that revolves around the idea of the Salvation of humans.
After several asteroids were reported heading toward Earth, scientists worked day and night
to find a new planet. Several spaceships have already taken off with millions of humans.
Your task is to collect as many humans as you can and reach the space station in the
provided time and ultimately play a vital role in saving humanity.

#### Features:
The game has a bus as the main object. You use the arrow keys to move around and
rescue people. On your way, you will see many asteroids which you must avoid. You also
have a time limit of 5 minutes to complete the task or your mission will fail and the
spaceship will launch without you and your rescued people.
